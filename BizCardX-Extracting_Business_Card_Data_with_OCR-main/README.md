## What is EasyOCR?

   EasyOCR, as the name suggests, is a Python package that allows computer vision developers to effortlessly perform Optical Character Recognition.It is a Python library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) that allows you to easily extract text from images and scanned documents. In my project I am using easyOCR to extract text from **business cards.**
   
   When it comes to OCR, EasyOCR is by far the most straightforward way to apply Optical Character Recognition:

   - The EasyOCR package can be installed with a single pip command.
   - The dependencies on the EasyOCR package are minimal, making it easy to configure your OCR development environment.
   - Once EasyOCR is installed, only one import statement is required to import the package into your project.
   - From there, all you need is two lines of code to perform OCR â€” one to initialize the Reader class and then another to OCR the image via the readtext function.

## Project Overview


Problem Statement: 

You have been tasked with developing a Streamlit application that allows users to
upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using
easyOCR. The extracted information should include the company name, card holder
name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state,
and pin code. The extracted information should then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).
In addition, the application should allow users to save the extracted information into
a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database should be
able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.
To achieve this, you will need to use Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database
management system like SQLite or MySQL. The application should have a simple
and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the
business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information should
be displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users should be able to easily
add it to the database with the click of a button. And Allow the user to Read the data,
Update the data and Allow the user to delete the data through the streamlit UI
This project will require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and
database management. It will also require you to carefully design and plan the
application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.
Good documentation and code organization will also be important for this project.

Approach:

1. Install the required packages: You will need to install Python, Streamlit,
easyOCR, and a database management system like SQLite or MySQL.

2. Design the user interface: Create a simple and intuitive user interface using
Streamlit that guides users through the process of uploading the business
card image and extracting its information. You can use widgets like file
uploader, buttons, and text boxes to make the interface more interactive.

3. Implement the image processing and OCR: Use easyOCR to extract the
relevant information from the uploaded business card image. You can use
image processing techniques like resizing, cropping, and thresholding to
enhance the image quality before passing it to the OCR engine.

4. Display the extracted information: Once the information has been extracted,
display it in a clean and organized manner in the Streamlit GUI. You can use
widgets like tables, text boxes, and labels to present the information.

5. Implement database integration: Use a database management system like
SQLite or MySQL to store the extracted information along with the uploaded
business card image. You can use SQL queries to create tables, insert data,
and retrieve data from the database, Update the data and Allow the user to
delete the data through the streamlit UI

6. Test the application: Test the application thoroughly to ensure that it works as
expected. You can run the application on your local machine by running the
command streamlit run app.py in the terminal, where app.py is the name of
your Streamlit application file.

7. Improve the application: Continuously improve the application by adding new
features, optimizing the code, and fixing bugs. You can also add user
authentication and authorization to make the application more secure.

Results:
The result of the project would be a Streamlit application that allows users to upload
an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using easyOCR.
The extracted information would include the company name, card holder name,
designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state, and pin
code. The extracted information would then be displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI).
The application would also allow users to save the extracted information into a
database along with the uploaded business card image. The database would be able
to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.
The final application would have a simple and intuitive user interface that guides
users through the process of uploading the business card image and extracting its
information. The extracted information would be displayed in a clean and organized
manner, and users would be able to easily add it to the database with the click of a
button.
The project would require skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and
database management. It would also require careful design and planning of the
application architecture to ensure that it is scalable, maintainable, and extensible.
Good documentation and code organization would also be important for the project.
Overall, the result of the project would be a useful tool for businesses and individuals
who need to manage business card information efficiently.
